This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project was created to allow people to find discord communities they would like to join through the use of user submitted servers, and the use of full text search to find those communities.
